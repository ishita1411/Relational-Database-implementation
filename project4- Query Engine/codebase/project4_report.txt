2. Catalog information about Index
- Show your catalog information about an index (tables, columns). 

-For Indices , another table in the catalog table with name 'indices' has been created to maintain the information about it.

-Indices Table contain Filename, TableName, AttributeName

3. Block Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your block nested loop join works (especially, how you manage the given buffers.)

-We created buffer of size(numPages*size). Iterate through the left relation and put that into buffer at the same time adding it to the hash table. 
-Whenever getNextTuple is called ,right relation is iterated to find the match in the hash table for the given condition. The result tuple is returned.
-Once we reach the end of the right relation, it get reset and the next tuples get loaded into the buffer, hast table is also recreated. 
-This loop will continue till we reach the end of left relation.

4. Index Nested Loop Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works.

-Left relation gets iterated and performs index search on the right relation.
-Whenever getnextTuple is called left relation is iterated ,index search is performed on right relation for the given condition.
-The resulted tuple is returned.
-This loop will continue till we reach the end of relation.


5. Grace Hash Join (If you have implemented this feature)
- Describe how your grace hash join works (especially, in-memory structure).


6. Aggregation
- Describe how your aggregation (basic, group-based hash) works.

Whenever getNextTuple is called on the Aggregate class
Input relation gets iterated and count, sum, avg, min and max also gets calculated.

We return the value and set flag for the end of file.

7. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?

- Have you implemented any optional features? Then, describe them here.

- Other implementation details:


6. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
